# README for Getting and Cleaning Data Coursera Project

# Introduction

The goal of this project is to excercise with raw data files and
put thema together in one output dataset, so called tidy data set.

# Submitted files

1. tidy_dataset.csv - the resulting tidy dataset. A csv with a header row.

2. run_analysis.R - is the R script with comments to follow the user through the analysis steps.

3. CodeBook.md is a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that I performed to clean up the data.
